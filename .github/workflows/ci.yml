name: CI

# How the CI Pipeline Works
# - The CI workflow runs on all push events and pull requests.
# - For pull requests from forks (coming from a different repository), we skip jobs/actions that need secrets (e.g.,
#   publishing results, integration tests) to avoid exposing them. Only safe checks like local tests and flake8 are run.
# - For pull requests from branches in this repository, the workflow is skipped to avoid running it twice (once for the
#   push and once for the PR).
# - The full workflow (including jobs requiring secrets) runs only on pushes events to branches in this repository
on: [ push, pull_request ]
